# Application Programming Interface

When working with Rest API services, it is a good idea to also show what
objects are used when communicating with the end-points (both in and out).
This way, it is easier to explain the results without flooding the
examples with `JSON` code.

## Objects

* TBU;

## Operations

The following operations are provided by the API via
[RESTful](https://wn.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
web services.

* [Get node status](GetStatus.md "c:run")
* [How the system react when the information is incorrect?](MissingFields.md "c:run")
* [How can we test communication with external APIs?](ConnectExternal.md "c:run")
* [How can a client send multiple attributes?](VariableAttributes.md "c:run")
* [How can we call dynamic controllers?](DynamicController.md "c:run")
